# **Games Dynamic Components**

1. **Objects main properties**: 

    * **Traps**:
        > HNS traps are a variety of objects that can take hit points away from other competitors when they touch them. Each trap takes the amount of HP according to it's size and rarity. The relevant equation to check that is:
        
        > Round(Rarity/Size)  -> This will maintain balance for each and every trap.


    * **Obstacles**:
        > The games obstacles are designed to be set on the field in order to make visibility harder in some areas and allow the runners to hide from the seeker. This mechanism will allow the game to be harder and harder according to the amount, size and complexity of each and every obstacle in the game. The relevant equation for obstacles is:

        > Round(terrain_size/5)  -> From our tests we concluded that fifth of the terrain is a good ratio for hiding obstacles.

        > It's important to mention that obstacles are pre-set on the map for now and may be randomized in future versions.

    * :saxophone: **Catching stick AKA Weapon** :
        > At a future update the games catching feature which now is conducted via a machine gun will be change to a more user friendly stick or tube that will catch the other player when bumping into them.
